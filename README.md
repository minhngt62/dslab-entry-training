# BK.AI - DSLab Training (Winter 2023)

The International Research Center for Artificial Intelligence ([BK.AI](https://bkai.ai/)) is a leading International Research Center for Artificial Intelligence of SOICT, HUST (VN) with focus on fundamental research, technology transfer, and education. The center has 08 research groups with more than 50 scientists from HUST and other experts from universities, institutes and technology groups in the AI-related areas. [DSLab](https://bkai.ai/research/machine-learning/) (Machine Learning) is one of these research groups.

This repository contains materials and corresponding practices about DSLab's training phases for winter 2023. The early phases start on the fundamentals of Machine Learning and Deep Learning with practices in the domain of NLP. The late ones then focus on Probabilistics Graph Model (PGM) and deep learning-oriented mathematics.

```
session_01                # preprocess text documents (e.g., TF-IDF,..) & regression
session_02                # K-Means & SVM
session_03                # ANN (e.g., MLP
session_04                # time-series data and RNN 
session_cnn               # CNN (e.g., Resnet-34,...)
session_attention         # hierarchical attention networks (i.e. GRU + attention mechanism)
